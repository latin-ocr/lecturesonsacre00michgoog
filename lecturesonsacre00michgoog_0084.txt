εξ1 OF THE PARABOLIC ΛΝΒ Lucu. 4.

“ For l boue elain umen, because oi my wouudtug;
‘¹ Ἀ young mun, because oi my hurt.

t‘ ll Cain shall be avengeuu seren times,

‘⁸ Certainly Lamech seventy und ceven.”¹¹

1⁴ ‘⁶ tf the murder of eain ehell be evenged'’ 'l‘hut is, “ tt mee
“ cevenfold uhull fall upon the head of him that murdero Cam, then ven·
‘⁴ geunce ceventy times ceren shall fall on him thut murdero Lamech? A.
greeubly to whutiupronoupcedby God neheltthvem etunsune chup-

¹⁸ Gen, ir. 23, 24. The Jews heve indulged grat liberty of fiction and
conjecture coneeminy this puroet, etich her mered no other ptupoue
then to render it utere peplexed to othere eleo, vho vere mcble to digne
their vihimsicul und absurd explicatione. To me there iuvery little obscu-
rity in the original ; lor though we ure necessarily ignorent of the nameul'
tte person ulto vro courdered, Ι ὼὶῃὶ it iu mllicierxtlypleln thet seneper-
oon wau murdeted hy Lamech, quy mnu,- for what theletus haveteigu-

men, proceeds entirely trontteh igmmoe ot the nature ot* the flebrevr
poene, and particularly ol the puuuemm orrepctition ol centio numbers.
ol the sentences, w'hieh our author heu explained in every macterly manner
in the l9th lecture. Not· iu there uny moue reason to distmguhh between
tlte youth and the mun, thau to utppooe ssaden mi smair ottu- thu the
wives of Lamech, wlco ure mentioued in the next line:

¹⁸ lladuh und Sillah hear my coice,
“ Ye wives ol Lamech attend, ω’

The truth ie, Lamech hed committed umurder: lre repente ol' the fect, but·
hupey‚ after the example of Cain„ to ecotpe wito impunito, und tnth thet
hupt¹ lte cheere his wives, who ure anxious for hie tute. 1t iu not to beneup·
ptised dunt he adds-essed them in verset the substance ol* what he naid hcc
huen reduced tn numbers l'or the sake ol preteetingitee'eilyin the memory.
‘l'his poem therefore constitutee c pert of history tuom to tire lerediteq ι’
und lloues intimateu to what Lamech it mutu, hemely, not to the eon· ot'
seth, the father οἲ Nouh, bnt to thiu Lamech of the need of cuin: what he
udde u to this effect: “ This Lamech, who truc otuu seed of cuin, is tue
‘¹ sume who complained to hie wives in those well-known uaditiouat
verser, &c.”

'l'hut Moses hus preserved many relicu ol' thiu kind, ir evident from the
fragments of verse which ure scattered throughout hir writingu, aud which
are very distinguishahle from his uuuul languuge. Such iu thut which he
relateu Gur. iil. 24. of the cherubu placed et the eust uf the gurden of Eden:
uttder which appellution l undetutund to be meent, not engeis, but the Equi
cucumer ol the Greek und Latin poen: the rencone for which opinion lhuue
morelully emtutned ln the Commentarieu ol the Royul Society et Gottin·
