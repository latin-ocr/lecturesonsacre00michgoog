poem is hvosold, litetal and allegorical. ll on the urst
reading nithe Psalm we consider the characteres David

in the literal sense, the composition appears sufficiently
perspicuous, and abundantly illustrated by lacta from dae
mered history. Tluuugh the whole, irsdeed,thereisau Ι,
unusual lervour ol language, a br'dliancy ol meupltcra

aud sometimes the diction is uncommonly elevated. aa

bad some intention ol admitting us tothe secret reoessca ’κ’

we turn our minda to contemplate the intemal sense,

and apply the same passages to the alkgoeioal Davida
nobles series ol events inpresented to us, anda meaning

not only more sublime, but even more perspicuous, ,
rises to the view. Should any thing at lirst appear bold· ⁴

it will now at once appear clear, expressive, and admi· ⁴
rably adapted to the dignity oi the principal subject.
