But the case is very different in literal translations from
the Greek or [attin.² The other remark, which 1 wish-
ed to recommend to your notice, is, that a Hebrew po-
em, il translated into Greeklor Latin verse, and having
the conformation of the sentences accommodated to the
Α s idiom of a foreign lunguage, will appear confused and·
ῃ ι mutilated; will scarcely retain a trace of its genuine
elegance, and peculiar beauty. For in exhibiting the
works of great poets in another languagc, tnnchdepends

upon preserving not only the intertui meaning, the force ·

and beauty as far as regards the sense, but even the
'r external lineaments, the proper colour and habit, the

movement, and, as it were, the gait of the original.

Those, therefore, who have endeavoured to express the
beauties of the sacred poets in Greek or Latin verse,
have unavoidably failed in the attempt to depict thern
according to their native genius and character3 and
have exhibited something, whether inferior or not, cer·

tainly very unlike them, both in kind and form; wheth-
er, on the other hand, they have been able to approach·
in some degree, their energy, their majesty and spirit,
is not our present object to consider.
