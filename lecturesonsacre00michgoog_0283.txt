specimens of poetical prophecy already quoted ltom the
historical hooks; and it only remains to shew, that it is
no less observable in those which are contained in the
volumes of the prophete themselves. In order tbe' more
clearly to evince this point, l shallcudeavoor to illustrate
the Hebrew parallelism according to its different species,
first by examhles taken lrom those boolts commonly al·
lowed to be poetical, and afterwards by correspondent
examples lrom the books of the prophets. Ι

The poetical conformation os the sentences, which
has be'en so often alluded to as characteristic ol the He·
brew poetry, consists chiefly io a oemain equality‚ re·
semblance, or parallelism between the membcrs of each
period; so tlrat in two lines (or members ol the same
period) things for tbe most part shall answer to things,
and words to words, as il' fitted to each other by alind
ofrule or measure. This parallelism has much variety
and many gradations3 it is sometimes more accurate
and manifest, sometimes more vague and obscure: it
may however, on the whole, be said to consist of three
specics. ..ι

The first species is the synonymous parallelum,
wlrcn the same sentiment is repeated in different, but
equivalent terms. This is the most frequent of all, and
isoften conducted with the utmost accura'cy and ueait'·⁸
ness: examples arc very numerous, hor will thersite

, any great difficulty in the choice of theme on tus ac·-

count l shall select such as are most remarkable in oth.
er respects.
