Moses loeseeing, hythe impulse oi divine inspira·

which the prople ol lsrael were universally to rdapse,
reprobates in the following terms the uices ol that un·
grateful prople, as il they had been already committed

Thus he speaks as if he were the actual witness of their
depravity‚ and presentat those impious rites, with which
they were about to violate a religion divinely instituted
through his means. Nothing can be more efficacious
tlon this kind ol anticipation to the clear, evidens, and
almost ocular demonstration oi things. On this account

it is a very common mode os expression in the prophet. ·

Obserre only with what exactness and perspicuity he
has delineated the Journey of Sennacherib towards leru-
