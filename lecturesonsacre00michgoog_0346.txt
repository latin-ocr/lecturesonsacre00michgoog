As pum! me wearied hut for ceuling springs,
Thm zinks exhausted in the summer’s chus-,5

so pantu my soul [οι thee, grem King of kings!
So thirsts to reach thy sacred testing-placo.

On briny tears⁶ my famish'd soul hm fed,
While naming foen deride my deep despairy
¹ ‘⁶ Say, where is now thy gmt Delium ssed?
‘⁸ Thy mighty (lod—Deam nudarer, ubero 2”

Ost dweu my thoughts on thom mico happy days,
When to thy [ane 1 led the jocund thronffi

Οιιι ιιιίιιιι was worship, all our plemure pruine,
And festa! joya stin clos'd with sacred song.

Why throb, my hem? Why sink, my mdd'ning ιοιιΙ 2
Why dmop to emh with various vom oppmu'd ἓ
My years shall yet in blimful &des mli,
And joy be yet nn innantem mia bmut. ,

By Jordan’s bas-ks nim demus steps 1 stmy,
O'er Hermon'u rugged rocks, md duem drwy
Ev’n there thy hand shall guido my lonely yay,
There, thy remembmnce shall my spirit cheer.

In mpid floods the yemnl tot-rents roll,
Hamhwundmg cataracta responsiva τους
Thine mgry billum overwhdm my mul,
And duh my amtter'd bath frum short ιο more.

Yet thy ιοὶι mereim, evm· in my night, ·
My hem shall gladdm ιιποιιφιι the tedium dnyy
And midst the dark and gioomy mades οἱ night,
To thee 1’11 londly tune the grdteful lay.

Rock of my hope! Great solace of my hem!
Why, why denen the offupring of thy care,
While muminss soen thu· paim ιιι· invidiam dan!
