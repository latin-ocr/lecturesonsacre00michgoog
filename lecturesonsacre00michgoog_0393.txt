heightened and illustrated by the circumstances of his
birth, ancemry, manners, or country. Since, therefore,
this poet was professedly the herald of the Olympio con.
querors, unless he had determined to assume great lih-
erty in treating of those topics, and even on some occa-
sions to have recourse totopics very foreign to the prin·
cipal subject, his poems must have been little better than
astaleand disgusting repetition. His apology, therefore,
is necessity, and on this ground he has obtained not only
pardon but commendation; and many things, which in
another poet could neither be defended nor probably en.
duretl, in Pindar have been approved and extolled. Lcst
lshould seem to essert rashly on this occasion, 1 will
explain myself by an example. The third of the Pyth-
innodes is inscribed to Hiero, at that time labouring un·
der a grievous and chronical disease. The poet taking
advantage of the opportunity to imperta degree of va·
riety to his poem, introduces it with a solemn address,
invoking the medical aid of Chiron or AEsculapius, if it
be possible lor them to revisit the earth. But surely, on
such an occasion, it would be excusable in no writer
but Pindar to expend more tltan one hundred verses, that
is, above half the poem, on the history of AEsculapius, ,
Nor indeed could we easily pardon it in Pindar himself,
hut from the consideration that he had already written
an ode (the fourth) inpraise of tlte same Hiero, upon a
victory obtained in the Olympio gamas. But we are
willing to excuse the boldness of a poet, who, even with
a degree of rash impetuosity, escapes from such narrow
limits into a more spacious field. lt is, therefore no dis·
commendation of the Hebrew poets to say, that in this ’
respect they are materially different from Findere nor
does it detract from the merit of Pindar to assert, that,
from the more favourable circumstances of the Her

brews, their lyric poetry minore genuine and perfect,
