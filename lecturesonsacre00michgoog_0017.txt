rntrtstn'ron’s sursera ix

tobe generally asefulr md some of them ιοο learned ιο ss intel·
ligible to any, but those who arc familiar with the whole circle of
Orienttl literature. l have therefore selected such of them ss 1
thought applicable ιο my present purpose; and, aa it was my wish
to confine this worls within as narrosr limita as my duty ιο the pub·
lic would permit, and ιο suffer in it nothing, hut what l esteemed
immediately usel'ul, l have taken the liberty of ahridging some,
vehicli l thought in aliteral translation might appear resisus to
the English render.

Some observatione of my own 1 have also presumed ιο introduce
among the notes. They were such aa ιο me seemcd calculated
ιο render the work amore complete compendium of critical aci·
enee. Aa l dnnot, however, think myself above censure,so 1
ιιιιοι Ι shall not be found ιοο obstinate for correction. Should my
indiscretim, therefore, have obtrudcd any thing which a fair and
liberal critic shall dcem impertinent or improper,l shall with
much cheerlulness, in a future edition, submit ιο its erasement.

lt was not till l had eonsultcd some of the first literary charae·
tctcrs concerning tlte propriety of substituting in the place of our
anthor's inimitahle Latin poema any English versione, that l ven·
tured ιο appear as a poetical translator. Even theol did not fail
ιο inspccr every nrndern author, who limagioed might fumish me
with compositione worthy ol appearing among the criticisms of
Lowth. l have preferred Mr. Merrick's Psalmstoany version
which l should have· been able ιο produce, (except, indeed, in a
single instance, where it was necessary that the measure should
be elegiae) notonlyon accountof their intrinsic merit, but inconse-
quence of the commendation which nur author has bestowed upon
them. By the ltindness of Mr. Mason also, this publication is eu·
riched with one of tlre most beautiful lyric productione in our lans
goage, l mean his paraphrase ol the xivth of lsaiah· Whenl
could find no translation ιο answer my purpose, l vas obliged ιο
attempt the vemitieatinn of the passages myself. The public will
therefore recollect, that l was a poet through necessity, not
choics; and will, 1 flatter myself‚ receive this as a sufficient
apology for the indifferent performance of that part of my under·
taking.

Presuming that it would be more agreeable ιο give the literal
trartslations of the Hehrew from works ol established reputation,
1 have taken many of them from our author’s excellent version of
lsaiah, from Mr. Blaney's ieremiah, from llishop Newcombc’s
Minor Propheta, Mr. Heath’s Job, and from Dr. Hodgson’s trans·
lation of the Canticlese and this 1 trust will be accepted by those
Gentlemen as a general acltnowledgment. Where these did ιιοι
furnish me with a translation, 1 have endeavoured myself to pro,
duce one as faithlul to the original as my knowledge of the lane
guage would admit.

Convinced on the whole of the utility of this publication, and
yet avare of my own inability ιο do it justice, l dismiss it with
ibat mixed emotinn of confidente and bumility, which suche sits
