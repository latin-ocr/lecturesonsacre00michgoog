of hopee its ingenuity in drawing pictores ol' future le-
licity; its credulity in cherishing these ideas, and the

lob thus expresses himself respecting God:¹

‘⁴ 1t1 called upon him and he should mswer me„
ssot could 1 scarcely believe thet he had heard my voice.’¹¹⁸r

This is admirably expressive both of the majesty of
God‚ and of the severity which he exercised towards

lob3 it is also no less descriptive ol the humiliation and
despair of the sufferer,
