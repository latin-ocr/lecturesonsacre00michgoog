not be allowed rn the Greek and latinpoeta yet they „-
cannot be accused ol'* any deficiency in perspicuity or
elegance, especially if rt be remembered that the objecta
which lumished them with this imagery were all famil·
iar, or, it lmay be allowed the expression, indigenous
to the Hehrews.

In a word, we may generally remark upon this head,
that all poetry, and particularly that of the Hebrews,
deduces its principal ornaments or imagery from natur·
alobjects: and since these images are formed iu the
mind of each writer, and expressed conformably to what
occurs to blesenses, it cannot otherwise happen, but,

that through diversity of situation, some will be more ,·

familiar, some almost peculiar to certain nations; and
even those which seem most general, will always have
some latent connexion with their immediate origin, and
with their native soil. It is the lirst duty ol a critic,
therefore, to remark, as far as is possible, the situation
and hahits of the author, the natural history of his coun-
lry, and the scene ol the poem. Unless we continually
attend to these points, we shall scarcely be able to judge
with any degree of certainty concerning the elegance or
propriety of the sentimenta: the plainest will sometimes '
escape our' observation; the peculiar and interior excel·
lencies will remain totally concealed.²⁶

ὓ We must not omit noticing in this place, ,those images which are· de·
rired from rivers and iountainr, and the earth recreated with raim <which
are indeed used by our poeta, but more frequently by the Orientale. For·
the acarcity of water, and the extreme heat of the aumrrrer, together with
the wonderful fertility ol the soil, when watered, render this a more ele-
gant and jocund compariaon in the Euat thau with us. ln spring and aum·

rivers and streame are dried up, the others are rendered briny, and all nrt-³
