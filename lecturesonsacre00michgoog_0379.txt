nuce. 25. ntnlc POETRY. ³5⁹

Although' the lyrie poetry of the Hebrews is always
occupied upon serious subjects, nor ever descendam
that levity which is admitted into that of other natione,
the character of sweetness is by no means inconsistent
with it. The sweetness of the Hebrew ode consiste in
the gentle and tender passione which it excites; in the
gay and llorid imagery, andin the charte and unostenta·
tious diction which it employa. The passione which it
generally affecta are those of love, tenderness, hope,
cheerlolness, and pensive sorrow. In the sixtyahird
Psalm the royal prophet, supposed to be then an exile in
the wildemess, expresses most elegantly the sentiments
of tendemess and love. The voice of grief and com·
plaint is tempered with the consolatione of hope in the
eightieth Psalm: and the ninety-second consists wholly
of joy, which is not the less sincere, because itis not
excessive. The sweetness of all these in composition,

sentiment, diction, and arrangement, has never been
equalled by the linest productioris ol all the heathen
Muses and Graces united. Thongb none of the above

are deficient in imagery, 1 must confess Ι bave never
met with any image so trnly pleasing and delightful as

tbe following description ol' the Deity in the characterl
ol a shepberd:

‘⁴ The Lord is my shepherd‚ 1 shall not vante
“ In tendet gracche giveth me to lie donna
‘⁴ He guiteth rne to streame that gently flow.”¹⁸
