There is a peculiar figure which is frequently utade use
of in this species of parallelism, und which seems alto·
gether poetical: that is, when a definite number is put
lor an indefinite, principum, it should seem, for the sake
ol the parallelism: for it sometimes happens, that the
circumstances afterwards enumerated do not accurately
accord with the number specilieda

The variety in the form of this synthetic parallelism

finite: so that sometimes the scheme of the parallelism
is very subtile and obscure, and must be developed by
art and ability in distinguishing the different members
pl the sentences, and in distributing the points, rather

tlran by depending upon the obvious construction. How
much this principle pervadas the Hehrew poetry, and
how difficolt of explication it is, may in some degree be
illustratedhy one example. This appears to consist of
a single line, if the sentiment only he considered:
