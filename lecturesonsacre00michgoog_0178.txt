obscurity, therefore, in which at first this part oi the
sacred writings was involved, is now ina great measure

os esents (the most certain interpreter of prophecy) has
completely laid open: from m'any the Holy Spirit has
itself condescended to remove the veil‚ with which they

understood, since the design of the lewich dispensatius
hasbeen more perfectly revealed. Thus it happens,

the ancient Hebrews were destitute, and which in truth
appear not to have been conceded to the propheta thern·

and comprehension of that part of the sacred poetry,
which is the most singular in its nature, and by far the
most difficolt of explanation. ’

practice of referring to former events with this very intent so certain, (see
Mirr. xxiv. 15, 37, διο.) that 1 cemrot hut consider it es the most pruni-
