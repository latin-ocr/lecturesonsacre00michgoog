taen dt). unewano POETRY} 111

Quem ln the llebtew poetry3 hut sometimes the gen-
uine danmatio, or dialogue form, is quite apparent, aud
the passage w’dl admit of uo other explanation. The
twenty-fourth Psalm is evidmuy of this kind, relatihg,
aa 1 formerly endeavoured to prove, 1ο the nnnafeniog
ol the arla to Mount, Sioua and the whole of the uam-2
action is exhibited in a theatrical manner, though the .
dialogue is not fully obvious till towards the conclusion
ol the poem. That remarkable passage ol Isaiah also,
deserves notice on this occasion, in which the Messiah,

coming to aengeance, is introduced conversing witha
’ chorus as on a theaue:

Cau. ⁸⁸ Who io thia, that comelh from Edoml Ι

⁸⁸ With garments deeply died from Botaral

⁸⁸ Thia, that ia magnificent in hia apparel ι

⁸⁸ Marohing ou in the greatneas ol hia auength 1
