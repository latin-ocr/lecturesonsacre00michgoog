in the Io ol Pluto, says (probably iu his usual tone of
irony) ol poets in general, might have actually come to
pass: ‘⁸ Hence‚'’ says the philosopher, ‘⁸ the god, hav-
“ ing by possessing their miuds deprived them of their
‘¹ natural reason, makes use of them, us well as of the
“ propheto and divluers, as his ministers, to the eud, that
‘⁸ we who hear them should understand, that matters ol
‘⁶ so great importance are not uttered by meu in their
“ sober seuseu, but that it is the god himself who utters
“ them, aud addresses us by their mouthu”
