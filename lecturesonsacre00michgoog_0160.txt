111 - Ι ALLEGORY. Lacr. to.

what monstrous blundershasan ignorunce of the Hebrew
idiorn produced!

There is, indeed, a certain form, which this kind of
allegory sometimes assumes, more perfect and regular,
which therefore ought notro be overlooked, and that is, .
when it occupies the whole compass and argument of
the composition. An excellent example of this may be
’ seen in that well-known allegory of 50101100,ο 10 which
oid age is so admirably depicted. The inconveniences
of increasing years, the debility of mind and body, the
torpor 01 the senses, are expressed, most learnedly and
elegantly indeed, but with some degree of obscurity‚ hy
different images derived from nature and common life:
for by this enigmatical composition, Solomon, after the
manner of the Oriental suges, meant to putto trial the
acuteness 01 his readers. lt has on this. account alford-
ed much exercise to the ingenuity of the learned, many
of whom have differently, it is true, but with much
learning and sagacity, explained the passage.
