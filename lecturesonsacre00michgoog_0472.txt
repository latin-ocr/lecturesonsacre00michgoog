evile, thet neither he nor hie edversario· ure eble to conceive bow it can
be consistent with e benevolent being, to plunge n good rnen into eo great
efflictionur nor hu God condescended to explain the motives of it to thern,

therefore, thet whet ie thus related of Setun be fictitioue, end all the rest
