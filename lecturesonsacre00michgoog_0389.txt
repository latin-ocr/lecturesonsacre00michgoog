The eighty-first Pselnr will-serreasr another example
upon this occasion, being pervaded by an exquisite
union of sublimity and sweetness. lt is an ode cont·
pnsed sor the feast of Trumpets in the first new
moon of the civil year.⁶ The exordium contains an

enhonation to celebrate the praises of the Almighty ¹

with music and song, und (as is frequent in these pro·
ductione of the Hebrews) is replete with animation and
joy evento exultatione

“. Sing unto God our strength ς
⁸⁴ ᾼ song of triumph to the God ostracon?

The different instrumente of ntusic are named, as is
common in the lyric compositione of att other nations:

⁸⁴ tate the psaltere, bring nither the timbrel,
‘⁴ The pleasant herp, with the lnte.''

The trumpet is 'particularly alluded to, because the sol·

the Mosaic lan. The commemoration oi the giving
of the law, associated with the sound of the erumpet
(which was the signal of liberty)⁷ introduces, iu a man·

which is expressed iu a very few words, “ the secret
plaoe of thunder”) and finally the eontention with their
Creator at the writers of Meribah. The mention of
Meribuh introduces another idea, namely, the ingrati-
tude and contumacy os the Israeliten who appear to
hare been ever unmindful of the 'favours and indulgence

To thee, street muse! 1 owe thia fame,
