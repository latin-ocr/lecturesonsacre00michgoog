The genem disposition ond arrangement of the hundred
end fourth Psalrn affords a most elegant exemplification
uf this construction. For the prophet, instancing the
greatness and wisdom uf God iu the constitution aod
preservation of the natural world, speaks of tlte actious
und decrees of the Almighty ih tlte present tense, as if
he himself had been a witness when they were brought
to light; and rlisplay's¹ their consequences and uses, and
what are called the final causes, in the future tense, asif
lookirtg forwardfrom' the beginning through all future
time.

But although these and some other passages will ad·
mit of this explanation, there are many to which it will
not apply. ln these the situation and state of the att·
thors are not so‘much to be considered, aa the peculiar
nature or idiom of the language. For the Hebrews fre·
quently make use of the future tense in such a manner,

that it appears not to have relation to the present speak· ,

er, but to the person or thing which was last spoken ott
'lhos when any action is connected trith another action,
or consequent to it; or when the same action is repeat·
ed or continued, when a person perseveres in the saum
action, or performs it with great earnestnesfit‘ruseiduity,
this is all expressed us is it were future.¹⁸ This form is
therefore distinguished by the grammariaus by the apg
pellation Gnatid, which is equivalenttoprompt, expe·
dite, or impending. Examples enough to this purpose
might bc produced from the passages which have been .
referred to on former occasions: for instance, from that
most elegant prosopopoeia of the mother of Siscra3¹³
frunt the allegory of the vine, which was brought out

of Egypt ;¹⁴ from the comparison founded on the ma·
