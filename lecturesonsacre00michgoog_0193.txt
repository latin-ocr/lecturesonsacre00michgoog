the part of a wisc man not rashly to condemn what we

These three forms, according to which, sor the sake
os perspicuity, 1 have ventured to class comparisons iu
general, are however not so incompatible, that they may
not occasionally meet, and be variously blended with
each other. That indeed appears to be the most per·

jects‚ and while it explains, serves at the same tirnc to
amplily and embellish the subject3 and which pussesses
evidence and elevation seasoncd with elegance and va·
riety. Α more complete example is scarcely tobefound
than that passage, in which Job impeaches the infidelity
and ingratitude of his friends, who iu his adversity de.
nied him those consolations ot tenderness and sympathy,
which in his prosperous state, and when he needed thern
not, they had lavished upon himc he compares them
