134 ALLEGORY. Lacr. lo. i

“ tion; for which reason a succession of this kind is
“called by the Greeks an Allegory,· and properly, in
“respect to the etymology ol the word ; but Aristode,
‘⁸ instead of considering it as anew species of figure,
“has more judiciously comprized such modes ol' ex·
‘⁴ pressiora under the general appellation ol metaphors.”⁸
1 therefore scarcely esteem it worth while to dwell upon
this species ol allegory; since hitherto l have made no
distinction between it and the simple‘metaphor: lor
many of the examples, which 1 produced as metaphora,
are probably of this class: the principle of ’ each is tbe
same, nor indeed would it be an easy matter to restrict
each to its proper limits, or to detine where the one
ends or the other begins.

It will not, however, be foreign to our purpose to re-
mark the peculiar manner, in which the Hebrew poets
use the congenial figures, metaphor, allegory‚ and com-
parison, and particularly in the prophetie poetry. When
they undertalte to express any sentiment in orrtameutetl
language, they not only illustrate it with an abundante
and variety ol imagery, but they seldorn temper or reg-
ulate this imagery by any fixed principle or standard.
Unsatisfied with a simple metaphor‚ they frequently nm
it into an allegory, or mingle with it a direct comparison.
The allegory sometimes precedes¹ and sometimes fol·
lows the simile; to this is added a frequent change ol
imagery, anderen of persons and tenses; through the
whole displaying a degree of boldness and freedom un·
confined by rule or method, altogether peculim to the
Hebrew poetry.
