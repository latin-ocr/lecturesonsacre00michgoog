‘tt Poat‘rc IMAGERY PROM laem.

‘⁸ Dcep calloth anto deep, in aba voice ni thy cauracts,
‘¹ All thy arares and thy billows bare gone over me.”¹⁴

Itmay nothe improperto remark in this place, that p
though this nretaphor is so usual in all the other sacred
writers, whenever an occasion presents itsell' of introduc·
ing it, the author of lob, in the whole of that poem, p
which srom thenature of the subject presented excellent l
opportunities of employing it, has not more than twice,¹⁵
and then but slightly, made thc least allusion to it. Na·
ture, indeed, presented a different aspect to the author,
whoever he was, oi that most noble poem, it, as many
learned men conjecture, it was composed in some part
of Arabia, ior which, Ι confess, diere is great appearance
of argument, srom that fanrons simile‚¹⁶ in which he coma
pares his friends with the perfidious brook; a compari-
snn manifestly taken from the rocky parts os Arabia,
and adorned by many images proper tn that region.

Finally, there isaspeciesof imagery derivedalsofrom ζ
natural objects, altogether peculiar to the Hebrews. A·
mong the mountains of Palestine, the most remarkable,
and consequently the most celebrated in the sacred poet·
ry, are MountLebannn and Mount Carmel. The one¹
remarkable as well for its heightas for its age, magnitude,
and the abundance of the cedars which adorned its snm-
mit, exhibiting a striking and substantial appearance oi
strength and majesty. The other, rich and iruitsnl, a-
bonnding with vines, olives, and delicians fruita ina
most flonrishing state both by nature and cultivation,
and displayinga deliglrtfnl appearance of fertility, beauty,
and grace, The different form and aspect of these two
monrrtains is most accurately defined by Solonion, when
he compares the manly dignity with Lebanon,¹⁷ and the

- beauty and delicacy os the female with Carmel. Eachol'
