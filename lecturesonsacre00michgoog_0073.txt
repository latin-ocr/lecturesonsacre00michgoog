ta its etymology, inexpressive of a composition eut nr
divided‚ ina peculior muner, into short and oqual s
sentences. ¹

TbemtureoitheGreekandLatinpoetry is in this
respect chy oppositu and that in conformity to tbe
pomus of the different languages. For tlte Greek, be·
yond every other longuags (and the Latin next to it) is
copioso, flowing, and harmonions, pomeraed ol a great
ssriety od meoeutes, ol which the impressionis so des,

jury to the different mares. But in the Hebrew lon· ,sl
gorgo the whole eqptyprny is different. Its lortn is sinr-

other, should becone altogether implicaret end oon·

Two observatione occur in this ploce worthy of at·

The first is, thata poem nansbted literally from the ·
Hebrew into tbo prose ol any other language, wbilstthe·
same forins ul the sentences romain, will still retain, sd
even as far aa rehtes to versification, much ol its nonve·
