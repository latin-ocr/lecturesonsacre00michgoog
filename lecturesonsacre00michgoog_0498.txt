400 0! THE POEM OF JOB· Lucus&

ro those who, by criticising it according to foreign and
improper mres, would make thet composition appear
lame and imperfect, which on the contrary is in im kind
most beautiful and perfect. lf indeed the extreme an.
- tiquity of this poem, the obscurity arrd the difficulty that
necessarily ensue from that circumstance be consideredr
aod ifsllcwcnce be rande sor the total want of plot and
corion, we shall hare cause to wonder at the elegancc
and interest which we find in its form, conduct, and
economy. The mmgement isperfectly regular, and

. every pert is sdmimbly adaptetl to its end and design. ¹

The antiquary or the critic, who hasbeen at the prins
to truce the history of the Grecian drama from its
first wealr and imperfect efforts, and has carefully ob·
served irs tardy progress to perfection,⁶ will scarcely, 1
duur, without astonishment, contemplate c poem pro-
duced so many ages before, so elegant in its design, so
regular in its structure, so animated, so affecting, so
near to the true dramatic model : while, on the conuu-
ry, the united wisdom of Greece, after ages of study,.
was not able to produce any thing approaching to per-
fection in this welk of poetry before the time of AEschy-
lus. But however this be-whatever rank may be as·
signed to fob, in acomparison with the poets ol Greece,
to whom we must at least allow the merit of art and
method; amongst the Hebrews, it must certainly be
allowed, in this respect, to be unrivalled. lt is of little
consequence whether it be esteemed adidnctic or art
ethic, a pathetic or dramatic poemr only let it be as·
signed a distinct arrd conspicuous station in the highest
rank of the Hebrew poetry.
