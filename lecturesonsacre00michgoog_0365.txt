poetry oi the Hehrews in general requires. As an in·-
s'tanee, l need only mention that admirable personilica·
uon ο( Wisdom exhibited by him, in which he has so
happiiy adopted the manner os his great predecessor?

'l'he Wrsdom of Solomon is also composed in imita·-
tion ol that prince ol didactic writers, but witha degree
of success very unequal indeed to thot ol the Son ol Si·
rach. lt is not, like the book which bears his nante, ι
translation from dre Hebrmr, but is evidently the per-
formance ol some Hellenistic lew, and originally written in
Greek. The style is very unequalr it is often pompous
and turgid, as well as tedious and diffuse, and abounds
in epithets, directly contrary to the practice ol the He·
bremt it ishowever sometimes temperate, poetical and
sublime. The construction is occasionally sententious,
and tolerably accurate in that respect,⁴ so as to discover
very plainly that the author had the old Hebrew poetry
fortiis model, though he fell far short oi its beauty and
sublimity. The economy ol tlte work is still rnore laul-
ty3 lle continues the prayers ol Salomon from the ninth
chapter to the very end oi the book; and they conse.
quently take up ruore thorn one hollos the whole. But
beside the tediousness of such an harangue, he indulges
io too great a subtilty of disquisition upon abstruse sub-
jere, and mingles many things very foreign to the na.
ture oi an address to the Deity: and aller all, the sub-
ject itsellis brought to no perfect conclusion. On these
accounts 1 agree with those critics, who suppose this
book to be a much more modern production than that oi
the Son of Sirach, and to have been composed ina less
enlightened age.
