character, the one proper orliteral, the otherallegoricah
and in their writings these subjectsare sometimes treated
ol in such a manner, as to relate either to the one sense

' or the other singly, orto both united. For instance,a

composition may treet of David, oi Solomon, ol Jerusa-
lem, so as to be understood to relate simply either to “
the city itsels and its monarcha, or else to those objects,
which, in the sacred allegory ol the lewish religion, ate
denoted by that city and by those monarcis: or the mind
oi the author may embrace both objecta st once, sotbat
the very words which express the one in tbe plain, prop·
er, historical, and commonly received sense, may typiiy
the other in the sacred, interior, and prophetie sense.
From these principles oi the lewish religion, thiskind
oi allegory, which 1 am inclined to call mystical, seems
more especially to derive its origine aud irom these we‘
must endeavour ut an explanation of it. But its nature
arsd peculiur properties will probably be more easily de·
monstrabis, if we previously detine, in what respectu it
isdifferent from the two former species oi allegory. ,
The first remarkable ‹lillerence is, thatin allegoriesol
the kind already noticed, the writer is at liberty to make
uae ol whatever imagery is most agreeable to his fancy
or inclinatior: there is nothing in universal nature, notb·
ing which the mind perceives, either by sense or refleo'
uon, which may not be adapted in the form oi a coo-
tinued metaphor, or even os a par-able, to the illustration
ol some other subject. T his latter kind ol allegory, on
the contrary, can only be supplied with proper nuterials
from the sacred sites of the llebrews themselves; nor
can it be introduced, exceptio relation to such things us
are directly connected with the lewish religion, or their
immediate opposites. For to Israel, Sion, Jerusalem,
itt the allegorical ss wellas the literul sense, are opposed
