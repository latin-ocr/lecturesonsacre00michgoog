200 susorum OF Ister· lis

of nn emtor and apoet. In the former obanter, ht
sddresses a very solenrn ond interesting oration to the
people os Israel,¹ exhorting thern, hythe mou inviting
promises, to the observance of the cotenont, end dis-
snoding them lrom the violation of it hy threots nithe
most exemplary punishment: sod ior the purpose oi
impressing the same more lorcihly on their rninds, he
afterwards, hy the command ol eod, emhellishes the
subject with all the eleganoeot verse? in n poem, which
hears every mark oi divine inspirationi. In these two
passages is displayed every excellenoe of whieh the
Hebrew longuage is onpehle in both qnciesd corn·
position ; ell thot is grand, loreihle, nod majestic, hoth
in prose and verse: From them too we maybeembled
easily to comprehend the differente between the style of
oratory among the Hebrews, ond that of their poetry,

not only in sentiment, botin the imagery, tlte strenge-

· ment, ond the longunge. 'Whoever wishes, therefore,
to sotisly himself concerning the true clament tud
genius ol' the Hehrew poetry, 1 would odvioe mluliy ἵ

to compare the two passages, md 1 think he will soon

discover that the former, though great, spirited, sod a· κ
bounding nith omanrent, is notwithstanding regular, ÷

eopious,end diffuse; thet, ¹with oll its vehemenoe and
impetuosity, it still preserves a smoothness, etemress,

md uniformity throughout; md that the htter, on the n

contrary, consists ol sentences, pointed, energetic, cott-

cise, ond splendide that the sentimenta art troly elevet·
od and sublime, the langoege height ond animated, the ¹

expression and phraseology nnoosrmon t while the mind
of the poet never continues· iixod to nny single point,
hut glauces continually from one object to another.
