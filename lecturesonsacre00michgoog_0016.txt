viii TRANSLATOR’S Phariaca

. loss in applying all the criticisms oi our author. On this account

luill venture to essert, that il¹ the genius ol the translator ap·
proached in any degree the clear-neas, the elegante, the elevatiora
ol the author, these Lectures in our own language would exhibit
the subject in a much l'airer and more advantageous light, than ιο
the original form. The English idiom, indeed, has so much great·
er analogy ιο the Hebrew‚ that the advantages, which it possesse!
ovcr the Latin, must be obvious to any reader tvlto compares tho
literni translations in each ol these languages.

But tho utility ol these Lectores, asa system ol triticiam, is pen·
hope their smallest merit. They teach us not only rastc but vir«
tue; not only to admire and revere the Scriptures, but to profit
by their precepts. The authorol the present norit is not ιο be
considered merely as a mosterol the general principles ol critis
cism; he has penetrated the very sanctuarios ol tnnrew litera·
ture ; he has investigated trith a degree ol precisiom which l'etv
critias hare οιιιιιοοιι, rhe very nature and character ol their corn·
position r ογ accurately examining, and cautiously comparing ev·
ety part nithe sarred writings3 ογ alorce οι genius, wbiehcould
enter into the very design ol' the authors; and ογ acomprehene
siseness olmind‚ which could embrace at a single rievr a 'vast se·
ries nl' correspondtng passages, he has discovered the manner, tlte
spirit, the idiorn ol the original, and hus taid down such axioma as
cannot ltil greatly to lacilirate nur knowledge and understanding
ol the Scriptores. 'l'he work wotrld amply rs pay tlte trouble ol

connected trith such rulrs arrd principles as may be applied with
the greatest advantage to other dillicult passages, with such eules,
indeed, as tvill enable us better to comprehend tlte whole, surely
it must appear inesttmahle in the eye ol any man, who has οι ιιι
at beart his nvn improvement in religious knowledge. Perhaps
tlte scrptic may leam lrom she porussi ni these- Lectores. that the
difficulties ol' which hc complains in the Scriptures, are difficulties
which might in some measure be removed by a little more knowl-
edge, arrd a little more diligente in the application ol it. Perhaps,

authors, tvlrom they hare pererrem, and talla liuently about lan·
gunges, the rudimenta ni which they have yet to icam, may lind,
to their great astonishment, that a degree ol penetration superior
to their own is able to discover at least a lew rays ol sublimity in
lite vvritings ol' the llehrrws.

account at least l nili venture to promise nissell the warmest
