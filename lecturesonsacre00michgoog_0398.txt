The heavens and the earth are involred as wibresaes,
which is a pompona form ol expression common with
. the Hebrew writers :⁸

“ He shall eall the haerens from on high ς

At length the Almighty is personally introduced pro-
nounciug his sentence, which constitutes the remainder
of the ode; and the admirable sublimity and splendour
'of the exordium is continued through the whole. There

not enough to say, that he has treated it in his usual

manner, with elegance and variety, for he has done more y
than could be expected from a person unenlightened by 3

divine truth, hc has treated it with piety and solemnity,

But that high degree of sublimity, to which the Psalm- ,

ist rises upon such occasions, is only to be attamed by
the Hebrew Muse; lor it is a truth universally ac·
knowledged, that no religion whatever, no poetic histo.
ry is provided with a store ol imagery so striking and
so magnificent, so capable of embellishing a scene,
which may be justly accounted the most sublime that
the human imagination is able to eomprehend.

The next example, which I shall produce, will be
found in some measure different lrom the former, inas·
much as the subject itself is possessed of the highest
dignity and splendour, though still no inconsiderable
part os the sublimity is to be attributed to the general

the ark of God to mount Sion by David, gave occasion
to the twenty-fourth Psalm.³ The removal ol the ark
was celebrated ina great assembly ol the people, and
with suitable splendour during every part of the ceres
