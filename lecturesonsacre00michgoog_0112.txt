86 POETIC IMAGERY FROM Lacr. 6.

dan, are denoted theinsolent and cruel tyrants of the
Gentiles. In this and other imagery of the same kind,
though the sacred writers presurae to attempt what would

the pleasant places of J ndea This very image is adopted by Eurus, e.
xxxii. 2. and again c. xxxiv. 18, 19. in which places the verb rapha· thriee
occurs in that sensae see also nar. vii. 19. But whether rata be spoken
of the motion of the river, as la the latin maerere (Vrsa. Georg. 1. 132.)
so as to signit'y the river, is not altogether so plain.

‘⁴ This word (reret) seems in the Arabia to convey·the idea of water.
‘¹ For there isa verb raa, ro afferri plenty ο] diener or to eman stagnans
“ water, aa a fieb-pand, or calley: and the noun rara, a qrranmy ⁰s vater
“ lying r'n thebanam os n aare, or clarem.” Η.

Δ gentleman of great learning and genius has fumished me with another
explicatior of thir passage, which perhaps will attract the ammaon af tlte
learned render.

This learned mart interprets the whole verse in this marmer e-“cmsume
rr the wilri beart of the mech the multitude of those who are maog ia the
“ calces of the nations; who excite themselves with fragments of silverr
¹⁴ disperde the people who delight in war.” The wild beast'of the raedis
tlte Hippopotamus, which lives among the reeds of the Nile: under this
metaphor the people of Egypt ia properly delinearet, which of ltself operta
the way to the explicationes the whole verse. For the Egyptians are in·
deed nllurlerl to through the whole of the passage: they were remarkable
for the worship of calven, and that oi Iria and Apin iu the form of an 013

¹ and for their religione danaes before these idola tn the music of timbrels.

The Chalrlee runs thus: ‘⁶ The assemhly of the among, who puttbeirtrust
‘⁸ ln the eslf-idola of the nations.”-“ Srang in the calves of the nations,”
is a phrase analogons to tlrat, Era. vi. 10. ⁴⁴ Be strong ἑτι the lord,” aad is
an Hebraism. The manner of dnneing in the worship of the Egyptian
idols, is confirmed from Exoa. xxxii. 6, 19. also both it and the nse of the
timbrel, Hrnon. Lib. ii. The word ππ is totally different fram tren, which
is also found in Paov. vi. 3. where the Vanam readers it bosun thee, or
better, carcia thee, since itis in hithpael, ln the chaldee it meana ta mnar-
ple,· in the Syriae to danae 1 in the Arabia ro epum whence in this place,
“ excite or stimulate themselves to dnncing.” ‘⁴ With fragments ofsilrer”
(so literally ς) that is, with the small pieres or lamina of uretal round the
timbrel, which produce the jingling nolae when tha instrument is beaten·
The tinrhrel was formerly a warlike instrument: “The Queen calle forth
“the band with warlike timbrels,” varra. Whenoe Pnnrrrrms also oppo-
ses the Egyptian timbrel to the Roman trnmpet in the battle of Actium
(Lib. iii. ix. 48.) lf we consider it in this light, it will serve much to clear·
np what follows: ‘⁸ disperse the people who delight in war.” Thus sve
have not only a clear description ol the Egyptians, bat one that agrees ad-
mirably with the context: “princes corne out of Egypt,'’ &c
‚larhor’e libre.
