hecra· THE SAGRED ntsront. tas

Another fable, which our commentator points out ss common to the lle·
brews with the Greeks and noman, snd evidently derived from the same
source, is the fiction of a golden sgr. 'l'o this purpose he cites the three
prophecics of lsaish, in which the kingdom of the Messiah is described, in
slmost the same colours as Virgil depicts tbc happy state of nome under
Augustus.

tle proceeds in the third place to point out the resemblance between the
poetic descriptione of s future state, which are furnished by the Hebrew
poete, and those of the Greeks. lle is of an opinion, contrary to that of
mmyleerned tuen, who have attributed themtothecelts,thattheGrceks were
altogether indebted to Egypt for their descriptione. He quotes Josephus,
who, speaking of the Essenes, s prople who as to country, philosophy,
opinions, discipline, were more Egyptian than lewish, adds, ‘⁴ that in this
“ respect they resemble the Greeks, namely, in userting that the good
‘¹ shall cnjoy another life, in aplesssut situation beyond the ocean, free
‘⁸ from storms, tempests, end all excesses of cold or beat, and which is
“ constantly refreshed by a delightful breese springing from the ocean.”-·
. ‘⁸ 'rte Greeks, in the same manner,” he observes, ‘⁸ have assigned to their
'⁴ heroes and demigods, the happiness of Elysium? 'l'he opinion of the
Bram‘sns is similar, who, the professor asserts, have borrowed all their
manners and philosophy from the Egyptians ss well ss the Gauls, the
Greeks, dcc. bc. lle thinks this hypothesis isclearly demonstrated by the
analogy between these opinions and the rites or ceremonies of sepulture
among the Egyptians. Bato, the Egyptian goddess, who presided over
the dead, had s temple built upon some flosting islanda in the Butic lake.
To this the Greeks ans, by their own confession, indebted for their fable of
Gharm, ἀι. for on the day appointed for burisl, the name of ths deceued
being announced, certain judges were convened st the lake, where s boet
was readys the pilot of which, in the Egyptian language, was called cna·
ron. Before the deceased was put on board, full liberty was given to all
present of secusing him. But if -lro accuser nas present, or ifhis accuss-
tion was proved groundless‚ the body was put into the boat, and carried across
the lake to the sepulchrslfrelds (Dion. Sre. 1.. i. cin.) Thesepulchres of
their kings also were situsted os islands formed by art, by admitting the
water of the Nile, ss llsaonorus testilies (L. ii c. m)

Moses, therefore, being educated among them, and initiated in their
bimoglyphie learning, to which the Grecisn mythology is under so many-
obligations, seems to allude to the fable of Elysium (or the blessed isles)
When in that beautiful poem, which constitutes the xcth Pseu, at the loth
verse, he thus expresses himself ε

“ The strength of our years isfllabour aad sorrow,
'⁸ lt passeth eser quickly, end we fly.

‘¹ The words sse Α, if 1 nnn not mistaken,” adds the professor, “ might
‘⁸ be rendered, sse ιιι soil, since there is something alike in the actions of
⁸⁸ ssilhrg snd dying, arrd theone is hequcntly assde ιιιι of poeticslly fer
“the other.''
