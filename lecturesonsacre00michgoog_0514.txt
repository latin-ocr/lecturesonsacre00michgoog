m ΟΞ THE POEM OF iOB. Lacr·- tt

ture of the Hebrew poetry, it is time that rny present
undertaking should draw towards a conclusion. ΙΙ in

the prosecution of my design, 1 have by my industry

been able to accomplish arry thing that-may be deemed
satisfactory, itis but common justice to attribute the
greatest part of my success to you, Gentlemen, vvho

have condescendet} to look with a propitious eye upon
my endeavours, and to invigorate my application by
your attention and partiality. When, indeed, 1 lirst
meditaret this system of instruction, 1 soresavv, as well
from the native sublimity arrd ‚obscumy of the subject,
as from the extreme antiquity of the Hebrevv writings,
much subtile investigation, much difficolt explication,
much doubtful assertion, and dangrrous error. 1 fore· '
saw too, and daily experience confirmed my apprehen.
sions, that in this mazeus science, the vestiges and the
documents of the learned would be frequently found
but imperfect guides. That my courage did not utter-
ly forsake me in tlte course ol' my· undertaking, is to be
attributed entirely to the favour aud encouragernent
which 1 received from you. 1 had the satisfaction to
lind my plan meet with the approbation of some of the
greatest and most eminent characters in the learned
world, as being neither inconsistent with tho design of
this institution, the dignity of ¹this University, nor the
profit and utility of the students. .·1 had osten the sin·
gular pleasure ol seeing, among my auditore, many per·
sons, to whom it would better become me to apply for
instruction in this and in every other braneb of litera·
ture; and the young men, for whose benedt this iusti·
tution was established, Ι have found ever diligent and
constant in their atteodauoe: all which testimonies of
your favour, unless Ι accounted as obligations, I should
think either too arrogantly of myself, or too disrespect·
