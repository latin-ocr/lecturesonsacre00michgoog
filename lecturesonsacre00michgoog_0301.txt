tion cl poctry, and in particular of the pambclic style,
the nature of which, as l have already copioosly stated,
is to alicrd ah abundance and variety of imagery of es·

alogy always preserved, is transferred from certain and
definite objecta. to express indefinite and general ideas.
Of all the images¹ proper tc the parcbclic style, it most
frequently introduces those which are taken lrom natural
objecta and from sacred history: it abounds most in
metaphora, allegorica, compariscns, and eren in copioua
and diffuse descriptione. lt possesses all that genuine
enthusiaam, which is the natural attendant on inspira-

clearness arrd energy os diction, and consequently rises
to an uncommon pitch ol sublimity: hence also it often
ia very happy in the expression and delineaticn ol the
passione, though more commonly employed in the ex·
citing ol them; this indeed is its immediate object, over
this, it presides as ita peculicr pmvince.

In respect to the order, disposition, and symmetry cf
a perient poem cf the prophetie lind, l do not know ol
ony certain delinition, which will admit of generd appli-
cation. Naturally free, and cf too ardent c spirit to bc Ι
conlitted by rule, it is usually guided hythe nature ol J ι’
the subject only, ond the impulse cl divine inspiration. s f
ruere are not wanting, it is true, instances of great ele· f
