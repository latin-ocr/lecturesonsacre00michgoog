m mue POETRY· Lacr. 17.

ty through the thick clouds that sunound it, we yet be-
hold with a mixture oi admiration and pleasurc.¹⁰

The rnost perfect example that 1 know oi the other
species oi the sublime ode, which 1 pointed out (that 1
mean which possessos a sublimity dependant wholly
upon the greatness of the conceptione, and the dignity
os the hnguage, without any peculiar excellence in the
{nnn and arrangement) is the thanksgiving ode oi
Moses, composed aiter passing the ned Sea.¹¹ Through
every part of this poem the most perfect puinness and
simplicity is maintaineda there is nothing artificial,
nothing iaboured, either in respect to method or in·
tention. Every part of it breathes the spirit oi nature

and oi passion: joy, admiration, and love, united with ¹

piety and devotion, burst forth spontaneously in their ]

native coiours. A miracle of the most interesting na. ¹

tute to the israelites is displayed. The sea divides, i

aud the tvaoers ate raised into vast heaps on either side,
while they grass over; but their enemies in attempting
to pursue, are overtvhelmed by the rehux of the waves.
'l'hesc circumstances arc all expressed in language suit·
able to the emotions which they produced, abrupt, ser-
vid, concise, animated, with a frequent repetition of the
same sentimenta:

⁸⁶ l will sing to Jssorss, for he isrery highly exaltedt
a The horse aad the ridet hc heth orerwhelmed io the rea-'⁹

This constitutes the proem oi the ode, andis also re.
peeted occasionahy by the female part of the band in
the manner of a modern chorus, being briefly expres.

10 haring pmsestcd abore, that 1 admired not so much the sublimity ar
the succini-ss of David's lyr-ic poetry, 1 think it my duty to make an cx·
ceptinn in favour os this Psaim, than which 1 do nst recouect any thing
more sublime in the whole boot of Psalmr. Μ.
