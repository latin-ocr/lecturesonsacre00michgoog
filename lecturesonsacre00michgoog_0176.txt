151 · THE Mtstlcat Leonti.

so that either may pass lor tlte original, wheme the oth·
er was copied. Neu light iaredected upon the diction,
and a degree of dignity and importasse is added to the
sentimenta, whilst they gradually rise from humble to
more elevated objecta, from human to divine, till at
length the great subject ο1 the poem is placed in the
most conspicuous light, and the composition attains the
highest point of sublimity. Α

What has been remarked concerning thisPsalm, may
bc applied with propricty to the seventysecond, which
eaactly resemblea it both in matterand form. lt might

The nature ol the allegory istite same with the 11111111
tha style is something different, on account ol the dis·
parity of the subject. 11 the one the pomp and splen·
dour ol victory is displayed; in the other the placid
image ol peace and felicity. 'l'hc style ol the latter is,
therefore, more calm and temperate, more ornamented,
more figurative3 not abounding in the same boldness
of persenilication as the former, but rather touched with
the gay 1111 cheersul colouring of nature, in its most
flourishing and delightful state. From this example
some light will be thrown upon the nature of the para·
bolic style3 in particular it will appear admirably adapt-
ed to this kind of allegory, on account ol ita abounding
so much 111 this species ο1 imagery. For as the image·
ry ol nature is equally calculated to express the ideas of
divine and spiritual, or os human things, a certain anal·
ogy being preserved in each; so it easily admits 11111
degree ol ambiguity, which appears essential to this
figure. By these means the composition isat the same
11111 diversified and perspicuoua, applicabis to both
sesses, 'and obscure in neither3 and completely com·
prehending both parts oi the allegory, ntay clearly and
distinctly be referred to either.
