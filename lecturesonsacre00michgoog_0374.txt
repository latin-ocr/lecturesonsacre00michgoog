³⁵⁴ LYRlC poetar. Lacr. 2⁵.

The Hebrews cultivated this kind of poetry above
every other, aad therefore may well be supposed to have
been peculiarly excellent in it. It was usual in every
period of that tration to celebrate in songs of joy their
gratitude to God, their Savium, lor every fortunate
event, and particularly for success in war. Hence the
triumpha! odes oi Moses. of Deborab, of David. The
schools of the prophete were also, in all probability, co·
eval with the republic; and were certainly antecedent
to the monarchy by many years: there, as we have al·
ready seen, the youth, educated in the prophetie dis-
ciphnr, applied themselves, among other studies. par·
ticularly to sacred poetry‚ aud⁴ celebrated the praises of
Almighty God in Lyric compositione, accompanied
with music, Under the gor-ernmcnt of David, howev-

er, the arts of music and poetry were in their most y

flourishing state. By him no less than four thousand

singers or musicians were· appointed from among the

Levites‚⁰ under two hundred and eighty-eight principal

singers, or leaders of the band, and distributed into ’
twenty-four campanies, who officiated weeltly by rota- ,

tion in the temple, and whose wholebusiness was to
perform the sacred hymns3 the one part chanting or
maging, and the other playing upon different instru-
ments! The chief of these were Asapb, Heman, and
Iduthum who also, as we may presume from the titles
of the Psalms, were composers of hymns.'¹ From so
very splendid an establishmeut‚ so fur surpassing every

other appointment of the kind, some reasonable conjec· Ἴ
tures may be formed concerning the original dignity ἶ

the abore remark (which ou that account 1 would not omit) Ι am inclined
to think there is more foundation for our author-’e theory thau Mr. IL sup„
