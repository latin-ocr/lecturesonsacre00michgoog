³³4 · THE ELEG1Ac Pomm.. Lucana.

In life united equnl futes they share,
ln death united thure one common grm- .

svift u the engle claues the κήαι ny,

Thmugh husu of foen they bem their apid οοιιπος
Strong u the lion dtu-ts upon his prey,

They crush'd the nations with rezistlm force.

Daughters os Judah, moum the fatal day,

ln able grief attend your momrch's um
To solemn notes attune the pensive lay,

And nep those joy: that never shall retum ε

with various vealth he made your tenu o'erflow,
ln pdncely pride your chaum pmfusely dress'd3
Bade the rich robe with ardent purple glou,
And spurkling gem adom the tismod vent·

On Gilbot’s heights the mighty vmquinh'd fies,
The mn of Saul, the generunt md the jutta
Let streaming sonum ever fill theno eyes,
Let sacred tem bedew a brother's dunt!

Thy firm tesard rever'd thy David'u name,

’ And kindest thoughts in kindest acu expreu’d;

Not brighter glou the pure tud generum fimo,
Thu lim within the tendet virgin’n bremt.

But vain the teu, and vnln the humine sigh,
Though Sion'· echoes with our grie& renonum
The mighty victora fnll’n and mquish'd lie,
And m's refulgent mpom mov the ζωᾶ-
