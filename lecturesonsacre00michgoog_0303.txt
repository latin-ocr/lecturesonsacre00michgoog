lahomor O'P THE· enuntiante POETRY. ast

et introduces the subject hya magnificent exordium,
involring universal nature to the observation of these
events, in which the¹ whole world should seem to be' rn-
terested: ' ’ “’

‘ Draw near, O ye actions, and heseba,

‘⁴ And attend uoto me, 0 ye peoplel

‘⁸ Let the earth hear, and the lulness thereof·'
ι* The world, aod ιιι that spring lrom' tt ”⁸

He then publishes the decree ol innovas concerning
the extirpation of all those nations against whont‘ ‘his
‘⁸ wrath rs lrindled: ·” and he amplifica this act οι ven-
geance and destruction by an· admirable selection of
splendid imagery‚ all ol which is οι the 'sante kind with
that which'is made use os by the propheta upon similar
occasions; the nature of which is to exaggerate the
force, the 'magnitudej atrocity,‘ and importance of
the impending visitation ι whilst nothingoeterminare
is specilied concenring the manner, the time, the place,
or other minute circumstances. He first exhibits that
truly martial picture of slaughter and destruction alter
avictory.

‘⁴ And their slain shall be cast out;
‘⁸ And lrorn their carcasses their stench shall ascend;

⁰⁸ And the mountains shall ruelt down with their ιιιιοιι.”ο

He then takes a holder ssight, and illustrates his descrin
tion by imagery horrowed frotn¹ the Mosaic chaos
(which 'is a common source of figurative langoagc ou
these occasions, and is appropriated to the expression
ol the downfal ol nations 3) and, as il he were display.
ing the total subversion οι the universe itsclf:

⁸⁶ And ιιι tho host ol heaven shall waste ιιιιγι -

⁸⁶ And the hearens shall be rolled up like a acrollr
‘⁴ And all their hott shall wither;
