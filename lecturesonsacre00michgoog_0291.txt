The sublimet poetry seldom indeed adopts this style.

isaiah, however, by means of it, without departing frent
his usual dignity‚ adtls greatly to the sweetness oi his'
composition in the following instances:

⁸³ ln e little niger heve l {meren thee t
‘⁸ But with grear mercios will l receive thee nguine

There is a third species ol parallelism‚ in which tlte

sentences answer to each other, not by the itemtion of ‘

the same image or sentiment, or the opposition ol' their
contraries, but merely by the iorrn of construction. To
this, which may be called the Synthetie or constructive
Parallelism, may be referred all such as do not corne
within the two former classes: l slnll however produce
e few ol the most remarkable instances:
