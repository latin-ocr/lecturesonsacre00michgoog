not acrostict but in this ltst part 1 must remark another
peculiarlty, namely, that the lines are extremely short,
whereas in all the test they ate long.

The length 01 these menes is worthy os notice: we
lind in this poem lines or verses, which are evidently
longer by. almost one hall, than those which occur usu·
ally, and oh other occasions. The length of them seems
to be, on an average, about twelve syllables, there are a
few which do· not quite amount to that number, and
there are a lew which perhaps elrcded it by two or three
syllables: for although nothing certain can be determin·
ed concerning the number 01 syllables (in truth lpay no
attention to the fictions ol the Masorites) there is rootn,
nevertheless,for very prohable conjecture. We are not
to suppose this pe'culiar form 01 versification utterly
without designor importante: on the contrary, 1 am
persuaded, that the prophet adopted this kind 01 mette
as being more diffuse, more copious, more tendet, in all
respecta better adopted to melancholy subjects. 1 must
add, thatin all probability the funeral dirges‚ which were
sung by the mourners, were commonly composed in this
kind 01 verse; lor tvhenever, in the prophets, any fune·
real lamentations occur, ot any passages formed upon
that plan, the versification is, if 1 am not mistaken, 01
this protracted kind. 'lt this then be the case, we have
discovered a true legitimate form 01 elegy iu the poetry
01 the Hebrews. It ought, however, to be remarked,
that the same lrindof mette is sometimes, though rarely,
employed upon other occasions by the sacred poets, as

it was indeed hythe Greeks and Romans. There are,
moreover, some poems manifestly ol the elegiac kind,
which are composed in the usual mette, and not in un-

connected sunaus, according to the form 01 a funeral
dirge.
