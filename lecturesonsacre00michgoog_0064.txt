On the very lirst attempt to elucidate the nature of the
sacred poetry, a question presents itself uncommonly
difficolt aod obscure, concerning the nature ol the He·
brew verse. This question 1 would indeed gladly have
avoided, could 1 haue abandoned it consistentiy with my
design. Eut since it appears essential to every species
s ol poetry, that it bc confined to numbers, and consistof
some kind of verse, (for indeed wanting this, it would
not only want its most agreeablc attributes, but would
scarcely deserve the uanae of poeuy) in ueaung nithe
poetry ol the Hebrews, it appears absolutely necessary
to demonstrate, that those puts at least ol the Hebrew
waitings which we term poetic, are in a metrical form,
and to inquire whether aoy thing be certainly known
concerning the nature and principles of this versification
or not. This part ol my subject therefore l undertake,
' not as hoping to illustrate it by any new observatious,
