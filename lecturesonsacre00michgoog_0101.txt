mode by external objects on the senses3 and ol these,

images which are furnished by the seam, and chiefly

as lar as simplicity rs its object, it pursues those ideas
which are most familior and most evident3 ol which
there is such an abundunce, that they serveris well the
purpose of omament and variety, as that ol ihusuutiou.

Those images or pictores of extcmal objecto, which
h'lre lights adom and distinguish the poetic diction, are,
indeed infinite in number. ln an immensity of matter,
however, that wc may be enabled to pursue some kind
of order, and not wonder in uncertainty and doubt, we
may venture to fix upon four sources of these ideas,
whither all that occur may be commodiously referred.
Thus, poeticol imagcry roay be derived first, from nat·
ural objecta ς secondly, from the manners, arts, and
circumstances ol common life; thirdly, from things
mercd3 and lastly, from the more remarkable frou re·
eorded in sacred history. From each ol these topicsa
few cases will be selected, and illustrated by examples,
which though chiefly of the metaphorical kind, will yet
be in a great measure apphcable to the other figures
which lure been specificam these we shall afterwards
take an opportunity to explain, when not only the lig·
ures themselves ,will be noticed, but also the different
forms and rules for their introductiou and embcllish·
ment.
