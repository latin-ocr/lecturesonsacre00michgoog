'same' thought with different imngmy, an'd a dill'e'rent
choice of language3 so that the whole bears rather the
appearance os an accumulation of corresponding sen·
timente, thart an 'accurate and connected series of dif-
ferent ideas, arranged in the form ol a regular treatise.
1 would not be understood to insinuate, that the author
has paid no regard whatever to order or arrangement3
or that transitions truly elegant from one subject, image,
or character, to another, are not sometimes robe found;
this only 1 wish to remark, that the nature and design
of this-poem (being in reality a collection of· different
sentimenta or subjecta, each of which assumes the form
os a funeral dirge) neither require, nor even admit of a
methodica! arrangement. The whole poem, however,
may be divided into live parts; in the lirst, second,
‘and fourth, the prophet addresses tlte people in his own
person, or else personilies Jerusalem, and introduces
¹that city as a charactera the third part is‘supposed to

, be uttered by the chorus-ol Jews, represented by their

leader,¹’ alter the manner ol the Greek tragediest and
in the fifth, the whole nation ol the Jews, on being led
'into captivity‚ pour fourth their united complaints to
Almighty God. This last, as wellas the others, is di·
vided into twenty-two perinde, according to the number
ol the letters ol the alphabet; with this nifference, that
in· the four other parts the initial letters ol each period
exactly correspond with the alphabetical order. And
from thia circumstance we hare been enabled to form
some little judgement conceming the Hebrew merres.
