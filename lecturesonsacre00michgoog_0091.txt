Lacr. l. SENTENTIOUS STYLE. 6⁵

petual splendour of the sentences, and the accurate re·
currence of the clauses, seem absolutely necessary to
distinguish the verse: so that what in any other lan·
guage would appear a superfluous and tiresome repeti·
tion, in this cannot be omitted without injury to the
poetry‚ This excellence therefore the sententious style
possesses in the Hebrew poetry‚ that it necessarily pre. ⁸, γ
rents a prosaic mode of expression, and always reduc- ‘'
esa composition to a kind of metrical sorm. For, as
Cicero remarks, ‘⁸ in certain forms ol expression there
‘⁸ exists snch a degree of conciseness, that a sort of
‘¹ metrical arrangement follows of course. For when
“ words or sentences directly correspond, or when con-
“ haries are opposed exactly to each other, or even when
“ words of a similior soond run parallel, the composi-
“tion will in general have ametrical cadence.”” It
possesses, however, great force in other respects, and
produces· several great and remarkable beauties of com·
position. For, as the sacred poems derive from this
sources great partos their elegance, harmony, ant
splendour, so they are not unsrequently indebted to it
for their sublimity and strength. Frequent and laconio
sentences render the composition remarkably concise,
harmonicus, and animated; the brevity itself imparrs
to it additional strength, and being contracted within
anarrower space, it has a more energetic and pointed-
effect.

Examples sufficient to evince the truth of these re·
marks will occur hereafter in the passages which will
he quoted in illustration os other parts of our subject ε
and, in all probability, on a future occasion the nature
od my undertaking will require amore ample discus·
sion ol this subject.“
