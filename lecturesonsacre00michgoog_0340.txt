Thus far in generales to the nature and method of
the poem, and the form of the versificatiom it remains
to offer a few remarks concerniug the subject and tbe

Sty'iiliat the subject of the Lamentations is the destruc.

tion ol the holy city and temple, the overthrow of the

state, the exterminationes the people‚ and tbat these. ¹

events are described as actually accderplished, aud not
in the style of prediction merely, must be evident to ev·
ery reader- T hough some authors of considerable rep·
utation¹⁷ have imagined this poem to have been compos»
ed on the death of king J osiah. The prophet. indeed,
has so copiously‚ so tenderly, and poetically bewailed
the misfortunes of his country, that he seeum complete-
ly to have fulfilled the office and duty ofamoumer. Iu
my opinion, there is not extant any poem, which displays
such a happy and splendid selection of imagery iu so
cenaene-ned a state. What can be more elegant and¹
poetical, than the description of that once flourishing ci·
ty, lately chief among the natione, sitting in tbe charae.
ter of a female, solitary‚ afflicted‚ in a state of widuw·
houd, deserted by bertricum, betrayed by her dearest
connectione, imploring relies, and secking consolation
in vain? What a beautiful persenilication is that of
“ the Wnys of Sion mourning because noscare come
“ to her solemn feasts ?” How tender and pathetic are,
the following complaints?
