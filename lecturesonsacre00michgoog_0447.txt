The same image a little diversilied, and with greater
freedotu ol expression, ae better adopted to the display
of indignatiou, is introduced by Jeremiah,⁸ when he de-
claims against 'the defection ol the Jews from the wor-

lormer part oi the prophecy oi Hosea ought also to be
explained3 and whether that part of the prophecy be
taken in the literal aud historical sense, or whether it be
esteemcd altogether allegorical‚ still the nature aud prin-
ciples ol this ligure, which seems consecrated in some
measure to this subject, will evidently appear. None
ol the prophete, however, have applied the image with
eo much boldness and lreedom as Ezekiel‚ an author
of arnust fervid imagination, who is little studious of
elegance‚ or cautious ol offending; insomuch, thatI

am under some apprehension ol his incurring no incon.
siderable share oi censure from those ouer-delicate crit·
ics who have been emitted from the Gallio schools.⁶
