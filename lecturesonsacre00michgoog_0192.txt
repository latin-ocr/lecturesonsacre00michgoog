showcrs thot fertilizc thc earth: an image which is u-
niformly appropriated to that purpose:

‘⁴ Veriiy like as the rain descendcth‚

“ And the cnon from the heavens3

“ And thither it doth not return r

‘⁸ But moisteneth the earth,

“ And muketh it generate, and put forth its incremt

¹⁸ That it may give seed to the coner, end bread to the uter:
‘⁸ So chail bethe word which goeth from my mouth3

‘⁸ It cheli not return uoto me fruitlccs5

More exampleS, und of superior elegance, may be found
in the Song of Solomon :²⁶ it must not, indeed, be dis·
sembled, that there are sonte in that poem, which are
very reprehendun, on account of that general disso-
' nance, and funciful agreement, which 1' have just re-
marked²⁷ asa great imperfectiori attending the free use
of this figure. We must be cautious, however, lest in

sonte cases we charge the poet with erroro, which are
in reality our own; since many of the objects, which
suggested these comparisons, arc greatly obscured, and
some of them removed entirely beyond the spherc of

thet the sacred crucies, however miraculos, otu most usundiy he fui·
filled; thot the reortl os God may be compared to cnoro or rcr'nf unct dm

the context, both from what precedes, and what follows. There is one
nimilcr io ch. xlv. 8, hut the idon is more condensod, assuming rather the
form of c metaphor or aliegury, than of a componor:

⁸¹ Drop donn, oye heuvens, the dew from ahorn

‘¹ And let the clouds showcr down righteousness:

‘⁸ Lei che earth open her bosom, und let eufration produce her fruit ς
‘⁸ And let justice puch forth her bud together?² M.
