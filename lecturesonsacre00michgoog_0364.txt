see no'tcason why his arsemina should not relate to the'
origiml Hebrew copy, rather titan to any Syriae version.
Howerer this may be, it is clear even imm tlte Greek

nomon, which we have, that the book in every re. ,

spect resembles the Proverba ol Solomon, as nearly as
an imitation can resemble an original. There isa great
similarity in the matter, the sentimenta, and the diction3
the complexim ol the style, and the construction of the
