ioeqnal disticha, for the most parta and why tltese tii»
tiohs should in some measureconsist ol versicles ot pat·-
allelistns¹⁰ corresponding to each other. And this motio
of composition being admimbly adapted to the musical
modulation ol that kind of poetry, which was most in
use among thein horn the very beginning, and at the

same time being perlectly agre-eable to the genius and
' cadente ol the langnage, easily extended itself into the
other species of poetry, though not designati l'or the same
purpose3 in lact, we find that it pervaded the whole ol
the poetry ol the Hebrews3 insomuch, that what was
said of the Heathen Muses may still more strictly beap·
plied to those ol the Hebrews,-“ they love alternate
song.” On this occasion also lt may not be improper
to remark, that the word wanoh, which properly signi·
lies to answer, is used more generally to denote any song
etr poem 3¹¹ whence we can only infer, either that the
wool has passed frona particolar to general use, or tint
among the hebrews almost every poem possesses a sort
ol responsive form.

Such appears to have been the origin and progress ol

that poetical and artificia} conformation ol the sentences,

which we observe in the poetry oi the Hebrews. Tont
it prevailed no less in the Prophetic Poetry tlon in the
Lyric and Didactic, to which it was, in the nature oi

things, most adapted, is evident from those very ancient ,
