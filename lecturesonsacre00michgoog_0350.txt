220 THE enectae POETRY tussa

reasonable to request your attention, while Ι endeavour
to investigate, with some degree oi aecumcy, the nature
aud composition ui this poem.

The poet treats, though in uo common manner, two
common topica, and those the best adapted to the genu-0
ine elegy ; that 1 mean which tras employed in tlte oele·
bratiou ol the funeral rites; he expresses his own sor·
row; aud he celebrates the praises of the deceased.
Both sentimenta are displayed in the exordiumr but,
as might naturally be expected, sorrow is predominant,
and bursts forth with the impetuosity of exclamation:

‘⁴ The glory ol lsrael is slaiu on the high place„
‘⁶ How arc the mighty lalleu !¹’

Griel is of atimid and suspicious tempere and always
ready at inserting estrees for seli-tormenta easily offend-
ed by neglect, and utterly impatieut of ridicule or con·
tempt ε

“ They heard that 1 sighed, forthere tras noue to eomlurt mer

⁶⁴ All mine enemies hare heard ui my eslamity21ud rejoieed that
thou indictedst it.”²¹

So Jerusalem complains iuleremiah‚ exaggeratinginthe
strongest terme her own missortunes. Our poet leels

aad expresses himself iu almost the same manner:

⁸⁶ Dechre it not in Geth,

‘⁴ Publish it not iu the streete ol' Ascalon ς

‘⁶ Lest the daughters oi the Philistiues rejoics‚

“¹ Lest the daughters ol the uneircumcised triumph.'’

Δ look φημι in another place he himself explains it bys nord expres
sive of Hyma- l, however, agree iu opinion with those, who suppose this
lamentation originally to have burne the title of Keshet (a how) either iu
ntemury of the slaugltter made by tlte archer! of tlte enemy, ur dum the
heu of Ionatham of which particular mentionis msde verse 22. 'l‘he m
seem to have favoured this opinion.

‘¹ Kosa, or rather less, signifies in Arabis ts monem, aa is mered by
‘⁸ the learned Michaelis ε but ldo not remembcr an instance os this word

‘⁶ being used to signily poetic measure (or mette).” ll. Auhor’e Μία
