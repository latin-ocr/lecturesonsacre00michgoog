The Hebrews have nothing hat corrupti& with
those fabios, to which the Greek aad mum poeta have
recourse, iphcn amplification is required: nor eno wc
be surprized that integery so consecrated, ¹so diguiiied
by religion and antiquior„ and yet oi.·so·ohvious and
established acceptation as to be inteiligible to the meen-
est understanding, should supply abundant and suitabie
materiale for this purpose. The sacred poeto, there·
fore, resort in this cnse chiefly to the imagery of natum
and this they make use of, indeed, with so much eie·
gance and hoedum, that we have no cause to regret the
want of those fictione, to which other nations haue re·
course. To express or delineate prosperity and opu-
lence, a comparison is assumed from the cedar or the

The reason why great subjectu may thus be clevated by ucomprrioon with
muer, uppem to he, because the latter, being more familiar to our
mnes, and therefore easier os comprehensim, mrke s more distinct and
forcibie impression, and lead the mind graduniiy to the contemplation uod
proper conception of the greater objecto. Τ.
