' Yon may easily perceive, gendemen, how, in thie
iirst kind of allegory, the thera! may be mingied with
the figurative sense ς and even how graneid this prac-
tice appears, since light ia more agreeably throrm upon
1¹ the subject in an oblique manner, without too base and
direct an explication. But itisdifferent‚ when the neme
image puts on the form of tho other nort of allegory, or
parahle, asin Isaiah.“ Here is no room sor titml, or
< even ambiguous expressiones every wardia figurativos
the whole mass of oniouting ia taken from the same
pallet. Thus what, in the former qnotntion, ia ex·
pressed in undisgnhed language, mnnely, “the oasting p
⁴⁶ out of the natione, the preparation of the phce, and
·‘ its destruction from the rebuke of the Lord,'' isby p
lninh expresaed wholly ina figurative manner :···“ The ¹
‘⁴ Lord gadrered ont the stones from hia vineyard, nod
“obtentu bntwhenitdeoeiwed him,hethrewdown
'‘ its hedge, and made it waste, and commanded dre
“ clouds that they should rain no rain upon it.'’ Ex·
pressione, which in the one cone possessa poculiar
grace, would be absurd and incongrnows in the other.
For the continued metaphor and the par-able have a very
different aim. The sole intention of the fornice is to
embeilish a subject, to represent it more magnificentiy,
or at the most ro illustrate it; that, by deacribing it io
more devoted langnage, it may atrike the mind more
foroibly: but the intent of the latter ia to withdraw the
s truth fora moment from our sight, in order to conoeat
h (whatever it may contain ungraceiul or disgusting, and
ι to enahie it sewaly to insinuate itaeif, and obtain nn ae-
cendancy as it were by stealth. There is, however, a
species oi parable, the intent of which is only to ihus·
wate the subject, such is that remarkable one of Eze-

²⁴ Chap. v. 1-7.
