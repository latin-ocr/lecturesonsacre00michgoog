Laentl. ⁴ OF nonnul. 1⁹-
1f alter the memorable Ides os March, any one of the

Tyrannicidae had delivered to the populace aucha po·
em as this, had introduced it to the Saburra, to the aa·
semblies of the Forum, or had put it into the mouths ol
the common people, the dominion of the Caesare aud*

licentiooanesa ol the citizens to be reprored; were their
minda to be stinrulated to the love oi liberty, he imme-
diately attached them with some poetical production,
bold, animated, and severe, in the highest tone of cen-

sorial gravity, and yet in no respect deficient in ele. '
