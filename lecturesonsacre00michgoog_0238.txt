2¹⁴ annulum OF Lacr. ts

ments. 1 am indeed 01 opinion, that the Divine Spirit
by no means takes such an entire possession 01 the mind
01 the prophet, as to subdue oe extinguish the character
and genius 01 the man: the natural powers 01 the mind
are in general elevated and relined, they are neither erad-
icated nor totally obscured ; and thoughuhe tvritingsol'
Moses, 01 Davidand 01 lsaiah, always bear the marks
01 0 divine and celestial impulse, we may nevertheless
plainly discover in them the particular characters 01
their respective authors.

'l'hat species 01 the sublime, which proceeds· from 0
boldness 01 spirit, andan elevation 01 the soul, whether
inherent in the author, or derived from adivine impulse
and inspiration, is displayed first in the greatness and
sublimity 01 the subject itselle secondly, iu the choico
01 the adjuncta or circumstances (by the importance arrd
magnitude 01 which 0 degree 01 force and elevationis
added 10 the descriptione) and lastly, in the splendour
and magnificence 01 the imagery, by which tltewlvole is
illustrated. ln all these the Hebretv writers have oh
tained an unrivalled pre-etninence. As for. as'respocts
the dignity and importance 01 tlte subject, they not only
surpass ull other writers, hut even exceed the conlines
01 human genius and intellect.¹ The greatness, the potv-
er, the justice, the immensity 01 God; the inlinite wis·
dom 01 his works and 01 his dispensatione», are 1110001)- ’
jects in which the Hebrew poetry is always cottversant,
and always excels. 11 we only consider witha common
degree 01 candour hotv greatly inferior the poetry 01 all
other trations appears, whenever it presumes to treet 01
these subjectat and how unequal to the dignity 01 the
matter the highest conceptions 01 the human gentius are
found to be; we shall, l thinlr, not only acknowledge
the sublimity, but the divinity 01 that 01 the Hebtews.
