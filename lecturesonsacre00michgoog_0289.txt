Ι ; “ And thy redeemec ir the llely One ol israele
‘⁴ The God of the whole earth ehell he he celled.”³⁴

The sense has an alternate correspondence in these
lines. ln the following the form of the constructionis
alternate:

‘⁴ And his land is filled with silrer and gold;
w And there ir no end to his treestwest ·

“ And his land ie filled with horres,

⁸⁶ Neither ia there eny end to his oheriots.”³⁸

The following is perhapsa singular instance:

‘⁸ Who ie lilte nnto Jehoenh onr Godt
‘⁴ Who ie exalted to dwell on high,

‘⁶ Who humbleth himself to look down,
“ ln the hentens, and in the earth-”⁸⁶

llere the two members of the latter line ere to be re-
ferred sevemlly to the two preceding lines; as ifit
were z “ Who is exalted to dwell in the heavens, and
“ who humbleth himself to inspect the things that are
“in the eatth.'' , .

The antithetic parallelism is the next that 1 shall
specify, when a thing is illustrated by its contrary be·
ing opposed to it. This is not confined to any partic·
nlar form: for sentiments are opposed to sentimenta,
words to words, singulare to singulare, plurale to pht-
rats, &o of which the following are exemplos:

“ The hlowe of a friend are faithful ς

⁸¹ But the kiosee ol nn enemy ate trenchenons.³¹
⁸⁴ The cloyed will trample upon an banoy-eornm
⁶⁸ But to the hungry every bitter thing is secet.
