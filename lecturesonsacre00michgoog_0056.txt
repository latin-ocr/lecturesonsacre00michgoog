80 THE DESIGN ΛΝΒ ARRANGEMENT Lacca:

ligiou. It is my intention, gentlemen, to follow the
example of this great philosopher3 and since the uni·
versity has honoured me with this office of explaining
to you the nature and principles of poetry, 1 mean
to enter upon it from that quanter, whence he thought
himself obliged to commenee the study and practice of
tbe art. 1 have determined, therefore, in the first place,

to treat of sacred poetry, that species, 1 mean, which · y

was cultivated by the ancient Hebrews, and which is
peculiarly appropriated to subjects the most solemn and
“ sublime3 that should my endeavours prove unequal to
so great a subject, 1 may, as it were, with favourable
auspices, descend to matters of inferior importance. Ι
undertalte this office, however, with the most perfect
conviction, that not only from a regard to duty it ought
to be executed with diligence; but from the respecta·
bility of diat body, at whose command it is under·
taken, it ought to be executed with honour and repu-
tation; nor is it merely to be considered what the in-
tent of the institution and the improvement of the stu·
dente may require, but whatrwill be consistent with
the dignity of this university. Fur since the university,
= when it gave its sanction to this species of discipline by
a special degree, recommended the study of poetry,
particularly because it might conduco to the improve-
ment of the more important scientes, as well sacred aa‘
profane,⁸ nothing could certainly appear more useful in
itself, or. more agreeable to the purpose of this institu· ’
tion, and the design of its learned patrous, than torreat
of that species of poetry, which constitutos so consider,
able a part of sacred literature, and excels all other poe·

try, not less in the sublimity of the style, than in the
dignity of the subject.
