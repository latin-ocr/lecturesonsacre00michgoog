lyric poem can impart to a subject not in itsell sublime.
We have an example of this in the fiftieth Psalm t the
subject ol which is of the didactic kind, and belongs to
· the moral part of theology. It is at first serious and
practical, with very little of sublimity or splendour: it
sets forth, that the divine favouris not to be conciliated
by sacrifices, or by any nithe extemal sites and services
of religion, but rather by sincere piety, and by the de·
vout effusions ol agrateful heartr and yet, that even
these will not be accepted without the strictest attention
to justice, and every practical virtue. It consists there-
fore oi two parts: in the first the devottt, but ignorant
and superstitious worshipper is reproveds and in the
second the hypocritical pretender to virtue and religion.
Each part nithe subject, if we regard the imagery and
the diction only, is treated rather with nariety and ele-
gance, than with sublimity; but if the general effect, if
the plot and machinery of the whole be considered,
scarcely any thing can appear more truly magnificent.
The great Author of nature, by a solemn decree, con-
vokes the whole human race, to be witness of the judge·
ment which he is about to execute upon his prople;
the august tribunal is established in Sion ι

“ anorsn, God ol gods,

‘⁴ Hsth spoken, and hath summoned the earth,

‘⁴ From the rising to the settiog ol tlte sun:
“From Sion, lrom the perlection ol besuty, God lrath shincd.”

The majesty oi God is depicted by imagery assumed
from the descent upon mount Sinai, which, asi lor·
merly observed, is one ol the common-places that sup-
ply ornaments of this kind:

‘¹ Our God shall come, and shall nothe silents .

‘⁸ A lire shall devour before him,
⁸⁴ And amighty whirlnind shall surround him.”
