cesena Ol* ’ΠΕ H'EBBEWQ· ’ ³88

'than a conjecture, 1 do not herimo to onan to your
consideration. There appears to he something singular
in the retributiones this clm, aad a very free nse of
different metues. It neither cursim altogether of tlte
long verses, nor yet of the short ones (which are the
most usual in the poetry of tbe Hebrews ;) but rather
ol a very artful and happy mixture ol both, so that the‘
concise and pointed parallelisnr serves to correct the lan·
guor and diffuseness of the elegiae verse: and this form
ol versification takes place also in sonte ol the Psalms.
Certainly there is a great appearance of art and design in ·
this nice and poetieal conformation of dre periods: and
that no grace or elegance sltotrld :he wanting to this po-
ern, it is no less remarkable tor the general bearn,
splendour, and perspicuity ol the style.

Tc do complete justice to the eeononry of this excel-

lent productim, it is absolutely necessary to exhibit it .

in an entire state. 'Not to tire you therefore with a rep-
etition of the verbal translation, l have endeavoured to
’ express the general sentimenta and imagery-in elegiae
numbers. ’

Thy glory, lsraelndccupu ita luuguid head,
On Gilboa'r heights tlty rising beruty dicat
In sordid pllestbere aloen th' illustriore dead.
The mighty uictor lall’n and renquish’d lieu.

Yet dunrb be Griel-Hush’d be het· elarn’roua voice l
Tell not in Gatb tlte tidings ol our chame l

Lest proud Ptrilistie in our noes rejoiee‚
And rude barbatiane blast fuir lsrael's fame.

No ruore, 0 Gilboal hearenr rerirIng den
With rising verdure erown thy fated bend!
No rictirrr's blood thino altars dire imbrue l
For there the blood ot bearen’s elect war rhed.

The swerd ol Saul ne’er spent its force in air3
The shalt ol lonathan brought lon the branca
