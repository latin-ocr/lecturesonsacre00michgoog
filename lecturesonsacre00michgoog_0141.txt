Lisai. THE SACRED Hrsrour. 111

instance ln a regular order certain topica or common·
places of Scriptum, which seem to have furnished‚ if
not all, at least the principal part of these allusions: it
will be necessary at the earne timeto remark their ligur-
ative power and effect, and the regular and unilnrm
method pursued in the applicaricn of thern, which has
been already stated as characteristical of the poeticat
imagery of the Hebrews.

T he first ol these topice, or common-places, is the x
Qus and the Quinc, which compost the first pages s
of the sacred history. These are constantly alluded to,
as expressive of any remarkable change, whether pros·
perous or adverse, in the public affairs3 of the over-
throw or restoration of kingdoms and natione: and are
consequently very comaron in the prophetie poetry‚
particularly when any unusual degree ol boldness is at·
tempted. If the subject be the destruction of the Jew-
ish empire by the Chaldeans, or a strong denunciation
ol ruin against the enernies of lsrael, it is depicted in
exactly the same cclcurs, as if universal nature were y
about'tc relapse into the primeval chaos. Thus Jere· s
miah, in that sublime, and indeed more than poetieal
vision, in which is represented the impending desolation
of Judea:

‘⁸ 1 beheld the earth, and lu l disorder and confusion ς

“ The heareusalao, and there was no light.

‘⁴ 1 beheld the mountains, aud lo! they uembled3

‘⁴ And all the hills shook.

‘⁸ l heheld‚ and lo! thcrc was not a ruant

‘⁴ ‘And all the sutrls os the hearers were lled.

‘⁴ l behelh and lo! the lruirlur held (was maome) the desert;
“ And all its cities were thrown down,

‘⁵ Before the praemunirentur,

“ Belore tlte lierce licat ol his anger.”¹
