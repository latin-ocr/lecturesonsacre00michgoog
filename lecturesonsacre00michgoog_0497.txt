duan to Tbebest and on his refusal, attempts to nale
use ol violence. Theseus protccts Oedipus: and in the
thau time Polynices arrives, with a view of bringing

less the whole nature and form ol either the Greek or
the Hebrew poem bc changed; or unless the plot or
action be taken loom the one, or added to the other:¹
