copious; but if we consider only the constituent parts of

any productim, they will be found sparing in words,

concise and energetic. They amplify by diversifying,

by repeating, and sometimes by adding to the subjectr

treated rather diffusely ; but still every particular sen·¹

tence isconcise and nervous iu itsell. Thus it happens

in general, that neither copiousness nor vigour is want·

ing. This brevity of style isin some measure to be ate

tributed to tlte genius of the language, and in sonte

measure to the nature of the Hebrew verse. The must

literal versions therefore commonly fail in this respect,

and consequentiy still less is to be expected from any

poetical translationsorimitations whatever. Ἴ
Most of those qualities and perfectioris, which haro

been the subject of this disquisition, will be found in a t

very high degree in the twenty-ninth Psalm. The su·

sublimity of the matter is perfectly equalled by the uua
affecmdenergy of the style. ’ ’
