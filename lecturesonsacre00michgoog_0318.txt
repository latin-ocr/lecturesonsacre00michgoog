Μ THE vacuatas curaturus laterata

we allow this just commendation tohis perspicuity both
in language and arrangement, we must not deny that
there is sometimes great obscurity observable in his

subject, and particularly in the latter part oi the proph·
eey.

lerome calls Amos “rude in speech, hutnotin knowl-
“ edge ;”¹ applying to him what St. Paul modestly pro·
sesses ol himself.⁹ Many have followed the authority
of Jerome, in speaking ol this prophet, as ii he vvere in·
deed quite rude, ineloquent, and destitute ol allthe ern·
¹ bellishments oi composition. The marteris, however,
iar otherwise. Let any person who has candour arrd
perspieacity enough to judge, not from the rum but
irum his writings, open the volume oi his predicemus,
and he will, 1 think, agree with me, that ourshepherd
‘⁸ is not a whit behind the very ehiefof tlte prophetam·
He will agree that as in sublimity and magnificem he
ia almost equal to the greatest, so in spleudour of dic·
tion, and eleganue os expression he is scaroely inierim
many. The same celestial Spirit indeed actuated lsai·
ah and Daniel in the court, and Arnus in the sheep·
folrls; constantly selecting such interpretem of the tli-
vine will as were best adapted to the occasion, and
sometimes “from the mouth oi babes and sucklingr
‘⁶ perfecting praise :” occasionally employing the nat·
ural eloquence of some, autl occasionally making othere
eloquent.

The style oi Mieah is forthe most part close, forcible,

pointed, and concise; sometimes approaching the ob·
scurity of Hosea ; in many parts animated and sublime,
and in general truly poetical.

' None·ol the minor prophete, however, seem to equal
Nahum, in boldness, ardour, and sublimity. Hisproph·
