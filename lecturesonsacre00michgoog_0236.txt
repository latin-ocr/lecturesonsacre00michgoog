it we attend diligently to the poetry nithe Hebrews, and
carefully· remark its peculiar characteristica, we shall
hardly lind any circumstance, the regular and artificial

so entirely inconsistent with prose, but that a few ex-

accounted as the certain characteristic ol poetry.

That the lull force ol' these and other peculiarities‚
which serve to distinguish the poetical diction nithe
Hebrews‚ and to preserve thet sublimity and splendour
lor which it is so remarkable, should be fully apparent
from a lew examples, is hardly to be expectede nor did

tered upon this part ol my subject. My intention was
only to produce an instance or two, which were rnost
likely to occur to those who enter upon this course ol
reading, and which appeared to demand particular at-
tention. The perfect character and genius, tlre whole
form, principles, and nature ol the poetical diction and
ornaments, can neither be comprehended in any rninute
or artilicial precepta whatever, nor perhaps be reduced
altogether to rule and method: the complete knowledge
and¹ perception os these are only to be attained by read-
ing and investigation, united with acutmess ol judge- <
ment and delicacy os toste.
