m THE SUBLIME Luce. rt.

Here indeed a spacions field presente itsetl to our

view: for by far the greater part of the sacred poetry ie·
little else than a continued imitation of the different pas-
sions. What in reality forrns tbe substance and subject
of most of these poems but the passion of admiration,
exeited by tbe consideration of the Divine power and
majesty; the passion of joy, from the sense of the Di·
vine favour, and the prosperans issue ol events: the
passion of resentnrent and indignatlon against the oon·
temnere of God; of grief, from tbe consciot'tsncss of
sim and terror, from tire apprehension of tlte Divine
judgement? Of all these, and it thee be any emotione
of the mind beyond these, exquisite examples may be
found in the book ol lob, in tlte Psalmo, in the Canti-
cles, and in every part of tbe prophetie writings. On
tbia account my principal difficulty will not be the se·
lection of excellent and proper instances, but tbe ea·
plaining of those which spontaneously occur without a
considerable diminution of their intrinsic sublimity.
Admiration, as it is ever the concomitant, so it is
frequently the efficient cause of sublimity. It produces

great and magnificent conceptione end sentiments, and

expresses thern in language bold and elevated, in sen· ,

rences concise, abrupt, and energetic.
