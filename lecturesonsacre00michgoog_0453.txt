able, strictly so called ς and the third, the mystical alle·
gony, which, under the veil ol some historical fact. con·
ceals a meaning more sacred and sublime. l must
confess, that 1 am clearly ol the same opinion with those
who assign this production to the latter class ol allego·
ries3 the reason ol which will be evident, il it be ad·
mitted that there is any thing in the poem at all allegor-
ical3 since there can scarcely be any doubt that it re-
lates in a literal sense to the nuptials ol Solomou.
Those also who are conversam with the writings of the
Hebrew poets will easily perceive how agreeable the
conduct of this poem is to the practice of those writers,
who are lond of annexinga secret and solemn sense to
the obvious meaning ol their compositions, and os look-
ing through the medium ol human affairs to those 'which
arc celestial and divine. The subject ol 'the Canticles
appears to be the marriage feast of Solomon (who viras
both in name and in reality the prince of peace ;) his bride
isalso called solomitis? the same name with a femi·
nine termination; though the latter Jews have strangely
disguiscd and obscured it hy a vicious pronunciatione
lor Solomon and Solomitis have evidently the 'same re-
lation to each other, as the Latin names Caius and Cala.
This circumstance ol the names was notro be disregard-
ed, since they seem to have a very strict connexion,

think, have never beau selected, to exemplisy the beamles ol ι aaron, ln
any composition that was not allegorical.
