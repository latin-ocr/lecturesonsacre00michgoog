Ltcr. tt. ‚ ALLEGORY· tas

does not wholly lay aside its own, For instance, in the
metaphor or parable, the lion, the engle, the cedar, con-
sidered with respect to theiridentical existence, are al-
together destitute of realitya but what we read ol David,
Solomon, orJ censalem, in this sublimen kind of allegoy,
may be either accepted in a literal sense, or may be
mystically interpreted according to the religion oi the
Hebtews, and in each view, whether considered con,-
junctly orapart, will be lound equally agreeable to tnrth„

Thus far this ltind ol allegory differs from the former
, in the ntater‘tals, or in the nature ol tlte imagery which

’ it employs; bu't there is sonte difference also in the torm .

or manner of introducing this imagery. Ihad occasion
before to remark the liberty, which is allowed in the con·
anacamptos, otmingtingthe incarnatae figura- 7·
tive meaning, tlut is, the obvious with the remote idea; ,
, which is a liberty altogether inconsistent with the nature
ol a parable. But to establish any certain rules with re-
gant to this point in the conduct ol the mysticat attegory‚
would be a difficolt and hazardous undertaking. For
the Holy Spirit has evidently chosen different modes of
revealing his sacred counsels, according to the circum-
stances of persons and tiniec inciting and directing at
pleasure the minds ot his propheta :¹ at one time dis·
playing with an unbounded liberality the clear indica-
tions ol future events; at another imparting some ob-
scure intimatione with a sparing hand. Thus there isa
vast variety in the use and conduct of the mystical alle·
gory; in the modes in which the correspondiug inrages
are arranged, and in which they are obscured oreclipsed

, by one another. Sometimes the obvious or literni sense

² And yet those metaphora andparables‚ the lawa and principles of which
otu· audior has so correctly murm, prooeed l'rom the same Holy Spirit, and
our author dora not deny hia being coulined by these lewa. M.
