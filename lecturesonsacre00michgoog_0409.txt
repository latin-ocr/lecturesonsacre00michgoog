an woconclude ons disquisition concaming the

lyric poetry oI the Hebrews, it will be proper to produce
a Iew specimens oi that kind oi ode, which derives suba
limity Irom several united causes, from the diction, the
sentiments, the form and conduct of the poem; and
which accumulates, or ina manner condenses and com·
hines all the beauties and elegancios of this style of comi

position. The poems to which Ι shall refer on this oc. ,

ousion, arctoo well known to require a minute explana-
tion, and indeed almost too noble and perspicuous in
themselves to admit 'oi any illustration from criticistng

it will therefore be sufficient to notice them in geneml ,-

tenns, or, at most, brielly to recommendafew passages,
which are perhaps so eminently beautiful as to deservo
particular attention.

The first instance 1 shall mentionis that prophetie ode
of Moses‚¹ which contains a justification on the partos
God against the israelites, and an explanation of the na-
ture and design of the divine judgements. The exor-
dium is singularly magnificeot; the plan and conduct
of the poem is just, natural, and well accommodated to

the subject, for it is almost in the order of an historica!
